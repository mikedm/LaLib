Header File of \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceLaLib}{La\+Lib}}, a linear algebra shared library for client with awful case of not-\/invented-\/here syndrome. All matrix operation results are passed in by reference. Modern compilers will utilize return value optimization (R\+VO) so we could alternatively design the interface to return the result vector without a performance impact. Pass all matricies by reference because if passed by value then a copy of the object must be made.
