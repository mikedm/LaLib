Brain Corporation Request for Single Code Sample for Michael Meloney

Introduction
Welcome to Michael's solution for Brain Corporation. Here you will find the shared library as requested. Additionally, there is a test application to demonstrate usage of the library and automated test to prove correctness. How is this achieved? There is a third package, generator, that takes advantage of https://www.numpy.org/, the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. This standalone application will generate know matricies and expected results. The TestRunner application will consume one of these test case files and run the results of LaLib against it in an automated fashion. The results are printed at the end of the test execution.

Full documentation is completed using doxygen. Please reference doc folder in this repo.
